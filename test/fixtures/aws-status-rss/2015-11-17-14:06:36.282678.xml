	  <description>Between 9:30 PM PST and 2:10 AM PST in the SA-EAST-1 Region, customers experienced increased delays in some metrics. During that time, alarms on delayed metrics may have transitioned into an INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. We have resolved the issue. Delayed metrics are in the process of backfilling in CloudWatch console graphs and for API retrieval. The CloudWatch service is operating normally.</description>
